# Algomonsta exercises

This is my practice repo for [Algomonsta](https://github.com/0xJohnnyboy/algomonsta)
Each part contains exercises, which I'm solving in here.

## Run tests

```bash
make test-all
```

```bash
make pattern={pattern} test 

:'
 {pattern} being the pattern you want to test, like two-pointers or sliding-window
 for example
 make pattern=two-pointers test
'
```
